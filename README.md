# Bubble_Geometry_Scalar_QNMs
The files in this directory can be used to calculate the scalar quasi-normal mode spectrum for the bubbling geometry set forth in https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08851 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13407. We use a Leaver code to calculate the QNM towers for low l values and low lying modes, then also make a comparison with WKB results for high l to demonstrate the methods are working.
